# This project focuses on analyzing a loan application dataset to uncover insights and patterns that influence loan approval outcomes. It involves detailed data cleaning, outlier detection, skewness treatment, and visualization to support business decision-making.

##  Objective

# To explore and analyze factors that impact the loan approval status of applicants using data wrangling and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques.

##  Key Steps Performed

 # Missing Value Treatment: Imputed missing values appropriately using median/mode.
 # Outlier Handling: Detected and treated outliers using IQR method
 # Skewness Removal: Applied log1p transformations to normalize distributions.

 
- # EDA & Visualization:
  - Univariate analysis using histograms and boxplots
  - Bivariate analysis to study relation with loan approval
  - Multivariate bar charts for combined insights
 
  - ##  Key Insights

  # Self-employed people generally request or get larger loans.
  #  No. of applicants who got their loan approved are graduates while not graduate applicants has lower approvals
